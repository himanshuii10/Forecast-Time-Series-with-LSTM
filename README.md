# Forecast-Time-Series-with-LSTM

# 1. What is Time Series Forecasting?
Time series forecasting is the process of predicting future values based on previously observed values over time. Examples include stock prices, weather data, sales data, and energy consumption.

# 2. Why LSTM for Time Series?
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to handle long-term dependencies in sequential data. Unlike traditional RNNs, LSTMs overcome the vanishing gradient problem by using memory cells and gates to control information flow.

Key features of LSTM:

>Memory cell: Stores information over long time intervals.

>Input gate: Controls which new information is added to the cell.

>Forget gate: Controls which information should be discarded.

>Output gate: Controls the output from the memory cell.

# 3. How LSTM Works in Time Series Forecasting
>Input: A sequence of time steps (e.g., last 60 observations).

>Processing: LSTM layers learn temporal patterns from the input.

>Output: Predict the next value (or multiple future values) in the sequence.

# 4. Applications
>Stock price prediction.

>Weather forecasting.

>Sales and demand forecasting.

>Energy load prediction.
